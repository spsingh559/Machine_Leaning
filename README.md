Case 1 :Salary Prediction using simple Regression Model.

Used Library:
Pandas
Numpy
Sklearn
matplot

Scenerio :
For given data of Experiance and Salary, need to train Algorithm to learn the corelationa and then predict the Salary based on unseen data or new data.

Solution:
Step1 : Data preprocess using sklearn and panda
Step2: used LinearRegression algorithm
Step3: plot graph using matplot to show correctness of system.

Run:
Clone repositiry
Go to MachineLearnign/learningApp/Regression/Section4-Simple Linear Regression
Now add your own CSV file if you have based on same format of existing CSV file in folder or use Salary_Data.csv for refereence
compile simple_linear_regression.py file.
Analyse the prediction through Graph.
